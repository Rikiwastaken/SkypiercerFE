[[Lyv]] : 
- 1->2 : 
- Lyv : Hi Sorak, are you training?
- Sorak : Oh, hello, Lyv. I thought I would try my hand at the spear.
- Lyv : It's... Not going well, is it?
- Sorak : Not yet, but one day. Young Elwyn wields the spear, and I still want to help him learn.
- Lyv : Maybe you can leave that to me? I don't really know the spear, but I can teach him the staff and the scythe.
- Sorak : Right, maybe I should focus on Lea, then. 
- Lyv : Yes, her style is right your alley. But then that leaves...
- Sorak : Zack ? You want to take care of him?
- Lyv : Well, I am not sure he needs us... He is just as good as us if not better with every weapon.
- Sorak : Just because he is a lazy genius doesn't mean he doesn't need training! Let's get him!
- Lyv : Right now? 
- Sorak : Yes, right now! With the two of us we will teach him discipline! After all it's training that separates a living hunter from a corpse!
- Lyv : Let's do it then. Together.

- 2 ->3 :
- Sorak : Lyv, are you alright?
- Lyv : It's... It's nothing.
- Sorak : What do you mean it's nothing? You got stabbed when you tried to heal me!
- Lyv: Maybe, but you are safe, right?
- Sorak : You idiot, I am the one who is supposed to protect you.
- Lyv : And why would that be? 
- Sorak : Because... Well... Because I'm sturdier!
- Lyv : Then you'll have to be even sturdier, because I won't stop helping you as long as you get in trouble.
- Sorak : What? That's stupid! If you're in danger because you're healing us without caring about your safety, then I'll have to jump in.
- Lyv : I guess I'll be in you care, then. After all, the safety of the whole team rides on it!
- Sorak : You're impossible...

- 3 -> 4 :
- Sorak : Hi, Lyv, what are you doing all alone?
- Lyv : I have been thinking. Say, do you have any plans for after the war? 
- Sorak : I haven't given it much thought. After all, it's not like we have anywhere to come back to.
- Lyv : Then why don't we make one?
- Sorak : What do you mean?
- Lyv : Well, there will always be pluvials, so we should build a new Hunter School. Don't you think?
- Sorak : I think that's a wonderful idea, as long as we do it together.
- Lyv : I wouldn't dream of doing it without you.
- Sorak : Let's build a home to come back to.
