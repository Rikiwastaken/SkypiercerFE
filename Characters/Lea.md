- Lyv : Hi, Lea. How are you?
- Lea : Lyv! You're just the person I needed.
- Lyv : Oh my! What can I do for you?
- Lea : Can you teach me telekinesis?
- Lyv : Sure, but why so suddenly? I mean, I tried several times already but...
- Lea : I know, I broke more windows than I can count, but being able to attack from a distance can be a real lifesaver in a brawl.
- Lyv : You know what? Let's try it! Here, focus and try to hit the target.
- Lea : Here I go!
- Zack : What the heck?
- Lyv : Holy cow, you almost decapitated Zack! 
- Zack : How? I was behind you.
- Lea : Sorry...
- Lyv : It's alright. Let's go over the basics.

- 1 -> 2
- Lea : Lyv, I need a hand.
- Lyv : Please, Lea, if it's about the telekinesis, I can't do anything about it anymore. I am sorry to say this, but you might be a lost cause. Sorry. But it's true.
- Lea : Ok that hurts a bit, but let's forget it. I need you to teach me about staves.
- Lyv : Oh, heavens... Don't you mean, like, greatswords? You can't hit things very well with a staff.
- Lea : I know. I want to be able to heal the others. Sometimes, just protecting them with my shield is not enough.
- Lyv : Hmm. I see. Ok, try to summon a staff.
- Lea : Ok, here it is.
- Lyv : It's really... Quaint?
- Lea : Listen, I know it looks like an oversized twig, but it must work all the same, right?
- Lyv : You know what? Let's try hit. As a matter of fact, I have a small bruise from the last battle. It's nothing, so it shouldn't be hard to heal it.
- Lea : Here I go!
- Lyv : Ouch! Did you just hit me?
- Lea : I... Isn't it how you're supposed to use it?
- Lyv : No, not exactly. Listen, I'll go over it with you, once again...

- 2 -> 3
- Lea : Look, Lyv, now my staff looks more than yours now! I mean, it still looks like a tree branch, but it's still a bit better!
- Lyv : That's some progress, well done! Zack told me you trained with him and managed to make his eczema less itchy. Well done.
- Lea : Yeah, I trained for hours on end, but it all paid off!
- Lyv : Well, it's certainly an improvement. What is that.
- Lea : Pluvials! Watch out ! I'll take them on, support me from behind.
- Lyv : Ok !
- Lea : Take that !
- Lyv : Lea, be careful, that tree!
- Lea : Thanks. Eat this !
- Lyv : Did you just hit the remaining pluvials with the tree?
- Lea : Sheesh, that was the last of them. I'm a bit tired, now.
- Lyv : You know what, with a strength like this, you probably don't need to use anything else than you shield and your strength.
- Lea : You think?
- Lyv : Yes. Believe in your skills, they're well enough to protect everyone. I mean, you did protect me just now.
- Lea : I... Thanks. I guess it's must fun that way too!
- Lyv : Right, you've always liked whacking things. 

[[Sorak]]

- 0 -> 1
- Lea : Sorak, do you have a minute?
- Sorak : Of course, Lea, what can I do for you?
- Lea : You have been fighting pluvials for a long time, right?
- Sorak : Yes for some years, now. Although it was mostly the weak pluvials that dared to attack the village. Why do you ask?
- Lea : Well, I am struggling a bit when we fight in the rain. I mean, it gets muddy and whenever I try to block an attack I'm always close to losing my footing.
- Sorak : I see what you mean. The answer is simple, really. Pluvials usually act on instincts from their past life. They will usually either blindly follow you or never move from where they are.
- Sorak : In the first case, you should lure them outside the rain, on rocky ground for example. In the second case, just rely on Elwyn's telekinesis, or the other idiot's bow.
- Lea : I get it. But what do you do when they don't want to target you? What I usually do is just ram them to make they focus on me.
- Sorak : I mean, another valid strategy is putting the enemy of their misery before having to block anything.
- Lea : I'll tell Elwyn and Zack to do just that.
- Sorak : Just tell Elwyn, the other idiot would just rush head on.
- Lea : Noted.

- 1 -> 2
- Lea : Hi Sorak, what's up?
- Sorak : Zack has been messing up with me even more since he has become our leader. Other than that, I'm good.
- Lea : I wanted to ask you something.
- Sorak : Of course, what is it?
- Lea : Why did you choose to become a hunter?
- Sorak : I think you and I have the same reason. There was someone I wished to protect, and so I enrolled. It's as simple as that.
- Lea : I think I know who it is.
- Sorak : It's obvious, isn't it. Anyway, I can say the same. It's good. We all need a reason to keep going. Protecting those you love is one of the very best there is.

- 2 -> 3
- Sorak : Lea, you really got better!
- Lea : It was just a fluke.
- Sorak : No, you won this duel fair and square...
- Lea : What's wrong Sorak? You're usually more into it.
- Sorak : You know what? I just realized something.
- Lea : What is it?
- Sorak : You all grew up so much. It feels like yesterday you were a little kid and now look at you.
- Lea : Come on, your embarrassing me.
- Sorak : Bear with it, because I won't say it twice. I know it wasn't easy, but now you're all as good as me and Lyv, maybe even better.
- Lea : Sorak...
- Sorak : I just wanted to say... I'm proud of you all.
