- Lea : Elwyn, I'm looking for Zack. Have you seen him?
- Elwyn : No, sorry. Do you want any help?
- Lea : Yeah. He's been missing for a while. I'm starting to get worried.
- Elwyn : Do you think something happened to him?
- Lea : I hope not... We have to find him. For all we know he could be all alone surrounded by pluvials.
- Elwyn : I'll go ask the others.
- Lea : Already have... No one has seen him. What if he is already...
- Elwyn : Calm down. he can probably look after himself. It's Zack we're talking about. When we were kids it was him who found us when we were lost in the forest, remember?
- Lea : Yeah, you were crying so loud he heard us.
- Elwyn : Hold on, do you hear that?
- Lea : Could it be snoring?
- Elwyn : Damn it, he is napping on that tree !

- Elwyn : Thanks for earlier, Lea. You really saved my bacon.
- Lea : It's alright. I was only able to do it because you got that enemy when I was getting overwhelmed.
- Elwyn : Don't mention it.
- Lea : We're really efficient when we're together, we should fight like this more often.
- Elwyn : Yeah. We really compensate for each other's weaknesses.
- Lea : If you want, I could teach you how to use shields.
- Elwyn : I don't know how to summon a shield Blade, though.
- Lea : Well, you could just take a real, tangible shield? 
- Elwyn : I mean... It doesn't hurt to try, I guess.
- Lea : Ok, let's train with this pot lid. Hold it firmly and try to defend against my punch.
- Elwyn : Are you sure about this? 
- Lea : Here I go!
- Elwyn : OOF.
- Lea : It sent him flying. Elwyn, are you alright?
